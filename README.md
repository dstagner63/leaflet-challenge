## General info
In this project I will create an interactive map with multiple layers. The map will include earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON Feed site. This layer will use circle markers with size controlled by magnitude and color controlled by depth of the earthquake. This layer will also include popups that provide information as well. The project also requires the use of another data set for plotting the earth's tectonic plates. This information will be added with a new layer to the map as well as adding additional base maps for satellite, dark, and outdoor. These layers will be selectable via the drop-down menu from mapbox.

## Technologies
* JavaScript
* HTML
* Leaflet
* Mapbox
* CSS

## Setup
You can view the map by opening the html file in a live browser.

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Circle markers of all the earthquakes 
* Dark, Outdoor, and Satellite map layers besides the street layer
* Plotted lines showing the earth's tectonic plates
* No TODOS for future development noted. All Level 1 & 2 requirements met.

## Status
Project is: Completed

## Inspiration
Using code to create visualizations of data
