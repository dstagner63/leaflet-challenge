## General info
In this project I will create an interactive map with multiple layers. The map will include earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON Feed site. This layer will use circle markers with size controlled by magnitude and color controlled by depth of the earthquake. This layer will also include popups that provide information as well. The project also requires the use of another data set for plotting the earth's tectonic plates. This information will be added with a new layer to the map as well as adding additional base maps for satellite, dark, and outdoor. These layers will be selectable via the drop-down menu from mapbox.
